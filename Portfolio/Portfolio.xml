        I programmed this scoreboard for the 2013 World Cup of Darts, using my knowledge of C#.NET. It can currently support Canadian national and international events.
        I also implemented the ability to change past scores, and a feature that records the match's data into a .txt file for later reference.

        I was contracted in August 2013 to do work for the 2013 WDF World Cup of Darts. On location in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, I was in charge of monitoring the event's livestream,
        operating the cameras and inputing player and match information and scores into the scoreboard.
